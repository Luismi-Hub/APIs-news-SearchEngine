# APIs-news-SearchEngine

This is a project made with JS where we get data from the net throw JSON files that we get using an APiKey.

For making this we use JS tools as AJAX and DOM.

The idea of this project is to create a dinamic web page where the content changes at the moment without refreshing the browser.
